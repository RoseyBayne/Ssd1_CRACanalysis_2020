# results

Tabular data and other results generated by scripts in directory `rmarkdown`. 


## RNA sequencing counts from Gene Expression Omnibus GSE148166

* `RNAseq_stressmatched_transcriptcounts.txt`

Generated by script `rmarkdown/process_RNAseq.Rmd`, using `multiBamCov`. 


## Ssd1 target lists

### Heuristically estimated from ratio of TPMs

* `Ssd1_targets_TPMratio4x_30C.txt`
* `Ssd1_targets_TPMratio4x_42C.txt`

Generated by script `rmarkdown/normalise_Ssd1_CRAC_counts_vs_RNAseq.Rmd`.

We conservatively report transcripts that are at least 4-fold enriched in Ssd1 CRAC reads compared to RNA-seq, and with at least 20 TPM in the RNA-seq data. 
This filters out low-expressed genes with noisy counts.

### Calculated by DeSeq2

* `Ssd1_targets_DeSeq2_30C.txt`
* `Ssd1_targets_DeSeq2_30C_4x_padj0p05_genesonly.txt`
* `Ssd1_targets_DeSeq2_42C.txt`
* `Ssd1_targets_DeSeq2_42C_4x_padj0p05_genesonly.txt`
